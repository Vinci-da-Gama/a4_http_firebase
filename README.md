# Bookmarks http with firebase

A simple Angular 4 web application that displays a quote. Demonstrates how to use the HTTP client.

To work on this project:

* Run `npm install` inside the project folder to download all the dependencies. This only needs to be done once.
* Run `npm run ib` to compile the TypeScript code in the `src` folder into ES5 code into the `app` folder.
* Run `npm run dev` to start a local development web server. You can now access the application at [localhost:5050](http://localhost:5050/).

This example is part of the **Angular 4 HTTP Firsbase** Author Collin.
